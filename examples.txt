Example 0: Most simple: One task sending characters, one task printing them
Example 1: Task specific variables (e.g. if you want to reuse the same function for independent tasks)
Example 2: Buffering
Example 3: Overflowing output buffers (first out of five events is missed)
Example 4: Two buffers independently feeding a sink
